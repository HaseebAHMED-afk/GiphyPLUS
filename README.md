This little project is the first entree in a collection of upcoming projects. These projects will be the clone of the original application but it will be their lite version.
GiphyPLUS is a lite version of the original giphy. It uses the GiphyAPI (provided by giphy, of course) and fetches data in 5 distinct categories. 
This application is coded purely in React and is using the Libraries/Framework such as :
Axios, to fetch data. 
Material-UI for the interface and other stuff. 
React Reveal for animation and classnames for multiple style classes.


I hope you enjoy it as well as I did. Stay Tuned for more projects.
